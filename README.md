## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The summary statistics can be seen in the screenshot below. The non random variance applications to from the data are vehicle length, spoiler angle and whether or not the vehicle is AWD. This is because they have the highest p-values. As seen below the p-value for the data is 5.35e-11 showing us that it is close to zero giving us reason to reject the null hypthesis. with an r-squared value of 0.749 we see that these values can predict the MPG fairly well.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
Below we can see the summary of statistics for the total and for each lot. In the total summary we can see a variance of PSI at 62.29 which is must less than the given requirement of 100 PSI. However, when looking at the lot summary we can see that lot 3 is well above this limit at a PSI of 170.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
Using the t test on all the lots yeilded mean value of x for all the lots. The values can be seen below in the screenshot. All the means for the given lots are around 1500 but the lowest is lot 3 with a value of 1496.14.
